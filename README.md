Recreating Bostock's [D3 Bar Chart Race](https://observablehq.com/@d3/bar-chart-race), but with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

## Want to help?
These are some Svelte issues on Github that would enable even better support for doing fully declarative data visualization that follow the D3 join pattern (enter, update, exit).
